# Deployment Electricity Usage Prediction ðŸš€

Program usage electict prediction using python environtment. i'm using Long Short-Term Memory to make model training and then, predict electricity usage for 1 day.

# Description

- [x] python train.py   : for training to make model LSTM with 7 day data
- [x] python predict.py : for predict with 1 day data
- [x] python train_predict.py : for running parallel serialize two program in top command

# How To Run ðŸš€

1. install python 3.7^
2. install requuirements in library import
3. ./Scripts/activate
4. python3 train.py
5. python3 predict.py
